# Predictive Maintenance

## Instructions to run the code

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Kafka (3.3 or higher recommended)
- MQTT broker - Eclipse Mosquitto (2.0 or higher recommended)

### Running the code

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gjaynir0508/iiot-project.git
    ```

    This creates a directory named `iiot-project` in your current working directory.

    ```bash
    cd iiot-project
    ```

    Open this directory in your favorite code editor.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

    Then open a terminal in the code editor or continue using the terminal you have open.

    The root directory of the project is the directory where the `README.md` file is located. All commands in this README file should be run from this directory.

2. Install the required packages:
    - Navigate to the project directory:

    - [Optional] Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - On Windows: Run the following command in the terminal:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Start Kafka server

   - Follow the instructions in the [Kafka Quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) to start the Kafka server.

   - Create a topic named `sensor_data`:

    ```bash
    kafka-topics.sh --create --topic sensor_data --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
    ```

   - Create a topic named `predictions`:

    ```bash
    kafka-topics.sh --create --topic predictions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
    ```

4. Start the MQTT broker
    - Add the mosquitto binaries to your PATH and run the following command in a terminal:

    ```bash
    mosquitto
    ```

    - There will be no output in the terminal, but the broker will be running in the background. You can check if the broker is running by opening a new terminal and running the following command:

    ```bash
    mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test
    ```

    - If the broker is running, you will see no output in the terminal. You can stop the broker by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
5. Now we start running the project's components. Run the following commands in separate terminals in the same order, all in the _root directory_ of the project:

    - Start the MQTT-Kafka bridge:

    ```bash
    python mqtt_kafka_bridge/bridge.py
    ```

    - Start the Inference server:

    ```bash
    python model/model_server.py
    ```

    - Start the Inference server:

    ```bash
    python model/model_server.py
    ```

    - Start the Prediction service that writes to the `predictions` topic:

    ```bash
    python model/predictor_kafka.py
    ```

    - Start the streamlit dashboard:

    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_dashboard.py
    ```

### Stopping the services

- To stop the services, press `Ctrl + C` in each terminal where the services are running. This will stop the services and close the terminals.
- Follow the reverse order in which they were started to stop the services. First, stop the streamlit dashboard, then the prediction service, then the inference server, and finally the MQTT-Kafka bridge.
- Finally, stop the Kafka server and the MQTT broker.
